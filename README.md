## 💧 Who am I?
```
Hello! I'm Andrey, a Python backend developer from Russia.
I develop reliable and clean backend systems and pay much attention to how things work under the hood.

I also like UI/UX design, so when the product is not only functional but also nice to use, that's a bonus. More recently, I've been into Kotlin and Android development, gradually moving toward full-stack mobile experiences.

I love learning new tools, playing with ideas, and creating something tangible out of raw thoughts.

You can see my tech stack below. Don't hesitate to contact-me - I'm open to interesting projects and ideas for conversations.
